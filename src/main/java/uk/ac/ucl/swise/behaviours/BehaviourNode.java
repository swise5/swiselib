 * BehaviourNodes are the behavioural units which identify the actions Persons take.
 * 
 * The nodes contain the behaviours the agents will undertake - e.g. going home, going 
 * out to work, spending time in the community, etc. They are joined together by 
 * BehaviourDecisionLinks, which dictate the circumstances under which each behaviour
 * (that is, each BehaviourNode) is activated.
 * 
 * When activated the BehaviourNodes return a *double* value - this is the
 * amount of time the Person will spend on the Behaviour unless they are interrupted
 * by some other thing. The Person can then use this value to schedule their next 
 * activation.
